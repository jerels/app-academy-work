# Data Structures Problems

Here are some important notes about this test.

1. When you do this project, _do not use the mocha command_. Instead, **use the
   npm test command**! This is the way that we can test that you wrote tests.
2. Do **NOT** modify the files in the "test" directory. _All_ of your work will
   happen in the files in _this_ directory: **01-array-based-queue.js**,
   **02-array-based-stack.js**, and **03-double-linked-list.js**.

## Usage

1. Clone the assessment repository from
   https://github.com/appacademy/assessment-data-structures-js-starter.
2. `cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install dependencies
3. **Run the tests by typing `npm test`**. DO NOT JUST USE `mocha`.
4. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the following JavaScript
   files so that when you run Mocha using `npm test`, all tests pass.
   * In **01-array-based-queue.js**, you will write a Queue using an array as
     the underlying storage mechanism.
   * In **02-array-based-stack.js**, you will write a Stack using an array as
     the underlying storage mechanism.
   * In **03-double-linked-list.js** you will create three methods on a
     partially-finished `DoubleLinkedList` class.


## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Delete the `node_modules` directory
2. Zip up your folder
3. Upload it
