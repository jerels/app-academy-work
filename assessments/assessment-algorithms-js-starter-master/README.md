# Algorithms Problems

Here are some important notes about this test.

1. When you do this project, _do not use the mocha command_. Instead, **use the
   npm test command**!
2. Do **NOT** modify the files in the "test" directory. _All_ of your work will
   happen in the files in _this_ directory: **04-tribonacci-memoization.js**.

## Usage

1. Clone the assessment repository from
   https://github.com/appacademy/assessment-algorithms-js-starter.
2. `cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install dependencies
3. **Run the tests by typing `npm test`**. DO NOT JUST USE `mocha`.
4. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the following JavaScript
   files so that when you run Mocha using `npm test`, all tests pass.
   * In **04-tribonacci-memoization.js** you will memoize an existing function
     that calculates the _nth_ Tribonacci number. (Yes, that's really a thing.)


## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Delete the `node_modules` directory
2. Zip up your folder
3. Upload it
