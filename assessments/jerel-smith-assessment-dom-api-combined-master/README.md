# Selection, Event Handling, and Storage Assessment Project

Clone the GitHub repository located at
https://github.com/appacademy/assessment-dom-api-combined.

Open the "index.html" file in a browser. The HTML page contains a list of tests
that you must make pass.

For example, the first test reads

> **PROBLEM 1**
> * Button `id`: `turn-square-red`
> * Div `id`: `red-outlined-square`
>
> When you click the button below, you should add the "red" CSS class to the
> red-outlined square. That will turn the button solid red. Write code in the
> "your-code.js" file to make that happen.

Open the "your-code.js" and write the code to make that happen. If you do it
correctly, then you can click the button and see the button turn red.

**Don't forget to refresh your page when you make changes in the JavaScript code!**

Make all of the tests pass by writing code in "your-code.js" and interacting
with the test in the way specified.
