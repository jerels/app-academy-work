# npm and Application Security

Sooner or later, you'll encounter a project that has a dependency with a
security vulnerability. To prepare you for that, let's practice auditing and
updating a package with security vulnerabilities. In this project, you'll:

* clone an existing project from a GitHub repository;
* use npm to install the project's dependencies;
* and use npm to audit and fix security vulnerabilities.

## Phase 1: Setting up the project

To get started with this project, clone the following GitHub repository:

[https://github.com/appacademy-starters/javascript-npm-and-application-security][repo to clone]

Then use npm to install the project's dependencies.

## Phase 2: Using npm to audit and fix security vulnerabilities

When installing the project's dependencies, you might have noticed that npm
found security vulnerabilities. Use npm to view more information about those
security vulnerabilities and to update the offending package.

To confirm that you've resolved security vulnerabilities, use npm to audit your
project's dependencies again.

## What we've learned

In this project, you

* cloned an existing project from a GitHub repository;
* used npm to install the project's dependencies;
* and used npm to audit and fix security vulnerabilities.
